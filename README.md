# Task Management Application (React)

This project is a task management application built using React. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage tasks efficiently.

## Features

* **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks with title, description, due date, and priority.
* **Edit Tasks:** Modify existing task details.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
* **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Toggle the completion status of tasks.
* **Filter Tasks:** Filter tasks by status (all, completed, pending), due date, and priority.
* **Sort Tasks:** Sort tasks by due date and priority (ascending/descending).
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.
* **Drag and Drop:** Reorder tasks using drag and drop functionality.
* **Local Storage:** Persist task data using `localStorage`.

## Technical Stack

* **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Hooks:** For efficient state management and side effects.
* **Material UI:** React UI framework for consistent and responsive design.
* **Redux:** For more complex state management if needed.
* **localStorage:** For simple data persistence.

* `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
* `hooks/`: Contains custom React hooks.
* `styles/`: Contains CSS files.
* `utils/`: Contains utility functions.

## Implementation Details

* **State Management:** React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are used for managing component state. For larger applications, Redux can be implemented.
* **Data Persistence:** `localStorage` is used to store and retrieve task data, ensuring that tasks are preserved across browser sessions.
* **Drag and Drop:** The `react-beautiful-dnd` library can be used for implementing drag and drop functionality.
* **Responsive Design:** Material UI's grid system and responsive components are used to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.
* **Filtering and Sorting:** Filter options are implemented using state variables and conditional rendering. Sorting is implemented using array sorting methods.
* **Date Handling:** Utility functions are used for formatting and manipulating dates.

## Evaluation Criteria

* **Component Organization and State Management:**
    * Components are well-organized and reusable.
    * State management is efficient and follows best practices.
    * React hooks are used effectively.
    * (Optional) Redux is correctly implemented.
* **User Interface and Experience:**
    * The application is intuitive and easy to use.
    * The UI is clean and visually appealing.
    * User interactions are smooth and responsive.
* **Responsive Design Implementation:**
    * The application adapts well to different screen sizes.
    * Material UI's responsive features are utilized effectively.
    * The Application is usable on mobile devices.

## Future Improvements

* Implement user authentication.
* Add ability to assign tasks to users.
* Integrate with a backend API for persistent data storage.
* Add task categories and tags.
* Implement task reminders and notifications.
* Add more filter and sort options.
* Add unit and integration tests.
* Implement more detailed date and time pickers.
